# Python

## Goals / Objectives

Goal:

>Learn the basics of Python in two weeks, through documentation and videos, able to create a functional application like a game or a chatbot.

Able to get that objective, I started watching some videos about how to create a game with Python using `Pygame`. 

Despite the fact,  I have always been a fan of video games, as a young teenager I didn't had access to a console nor a computer to play games. 

So why not try to make a fancy, retrospective game?

Objectives:

> Dockerize my Python applications.

I like to learn by practicing, therefore I decided to make more than one application, different types of application so I can improve my knowledge in Python.

> Not only did I create a game using Pygame.

>But also did  I created an application using open-cv, Flask, MySQL with phpMyAdmin and tried to dockerize my applications as much as I could.

## Python - Indentation

Other languages use { curly brackets } to define a scope.

> For example: `function(){}` 

In Python we use `indentation`.
A function declaration in Python will look like:
`def main():
    print(0)`
> Note: we use indentation to define what is the 'body' of the function
