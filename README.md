## Goals / Objectives

    Goal:
    Learn the basics of Python in a period of two weeks, through documentations and video's, able to create a functional application like a game or a chatbot.

    Able to get that objective, I started watching some video's about how to create a game with Python using `Pygame`. The main reason for this is because I always have been a fan of video games, but as a young teenager I didn't have access to a console nor a computer to play games. 

    So why not trying to make a fancy, retrospective game?

# Theory and Terminology 

### Indentation

    Other languages use { curly brackets } to define a scope.
    For example: `function(){}` 
    In Python we use `indentation`.
    A function declaration in Python will look like:
        `def main():
            print(0)`
        Note: we use indentation to define what is the 'body' of the function
