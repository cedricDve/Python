# Python Dockerized

Due to the fact I am using more then one computer, a desktop computer and a laptop. 
I needed a solution to be able to work productivly, without losing my time downloading software on each of my computers.

Therefore, I used Docker to containerize my application.

In this part I was experimenting with Open-CV.

> More info about open-cv and frontal face-detection can be found in Readme of AI\FaceDetection

## Objective
The objective of this application is to be able to dockerize open-cv in a Python environment.
Using Flask, to be able to display the application on a webpage, this way it is easyer to watch and discover the different functionalities.

# Run with a single-command

Using docker and docker-compose, by creating a dockerfile and a docker-compose.yaml file, it is realy easy to launch this application.
Only prerequest in ofcourse to have docker installed ( on windows I highly advise the docker-desktop version).

Once this done, in the command line type:
`docker-compose up`

> Note: you need to be in the Docker\FaceDetection folder.
